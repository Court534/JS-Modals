# Modal
This is a simple JavaScript demonstation of modals and modal windows using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Introduction
A modal window is a popup that appears on top of the main content and requires user interaction before continuing.

The modal window is created using HTML, styled with CSS, and controlled by JavaScript. It consists of a modal container, an overlay, and buttons to open and close the modal. The modal window is hidden by default, and it becomes visible when the user clicks on the open button. It can also be closed by clicking on the close button or outside the modal window.
